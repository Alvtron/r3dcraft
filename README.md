# R3D CRAFT

**R3D CRAFT** (pronounced “Red Craft”) is a high‑resolution Minecraft texture pack that stays true to the game’s original look while bringing every block and item to life with up to **512×512** pixel detail.

Whether you want smoother color transitions, realistic shadows and lighting, or added nuances like fine grain and weathered edges, R3D CRAFT enhances the default textures without deviating from Minecraft’s iconic aesthetic.
